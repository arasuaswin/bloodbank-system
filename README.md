## 💻 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- MySQL database

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the Next.js directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arasuaswin/bloodbank-system.git
   cd bloodbank-system/bloodbank-next
   ```
2. Copy the environment file and configure your database and secrets:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Push the database schema and seed default data:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   node prisma/seed.js
   ```
6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Local Production Build (Windows)
If you want to test the fully compiled production version of the application locally, you can use the included `deploy.bat` script inside the Next.js directory:

```cmd
cd bloodbank-next
deploy.bat
```
This script will automatically generate the Prisma client, push your database schema, run the Next.js production compiler, and start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

### CI/CD Practices (Continuous Integration & Deployment)
This repository leverages advanced DevOps methodologies to ensure seamless updates with zero downtime:
* **Fully Automated Pipeline**: Built using AWS CodePipeline. Pushing changes to the `main` GitHub branch automatically triggers a build.
* **Build Phase**: AWS CodeBuild creates a Docker container, compiles the Next.js app, and pushes the optimized image to Amazon ECR.
* **Zero-Downtime Rolling Updates**: AWS ECS gracefully rolls out new container instances and drains old ones only when the new instances pass ALB health checks.
* **Circuit Breaker Rollbacks**: If a bad deployment occurs (e.g., application crashes on start), ECS automatically halts the deployment and rolls back to the previous stable version.
* **Secure Secret Injection**: No passwords are kept in code or environment files on the server. AWS Secrets Manager injects credentials securely into the ECS task at runtime.

### Containerization & Application Performance
This project has been heavily optimized for cloud environments, significantly reducing AWS networking costs and startup latency:
1. **Next.js Standalone Output**: The Next.js configuration (`output: "standalone"`) automatically traces imports and bundles only the necessary node_modules. This shrinks the Docker image size by over **80%**, drastically reducing ECR storage costs and accelerating ECS deployment times.
2. **Multi-Stage Docker Builds**: The `Dockerfile` separates dependency installation (`deps`), compilation (`builder`), and execution (`runner`). The final production image discards the heavy compilation toolchains entirely.
3. **Least Privilege Execution**: The Docker container refuses to run as root. It creates a dedicated unprivileged `nextjs` user (`uid 1001`), completely nullifying entire classes of container escape vulnerabilities.
4. **Auto-Migration Script**: Database schema pushing is not an afterthought. The container spins up executing `start.js`, which detects if the Prisma database is in sync with the application code and automatically triggers migrations *before* booting the listener.

### AWS Services & Cost Optimization Strategy
This project leverages multiple enterprise-grade AWS services. Careful architectural decisions were made to provide high availability while keeping the billing tightly optimized:

* **Amazon ECS & Fargate Spot (Compute)**
  * **Role:** Orchestrates the Next.js Docker containers. 
  * **Impact:** Provides serverless scale-out without managing EC2 instances.
  * **Cost Optimization:** Instead of dedicated Fargate resources, the cluster is configured to use a `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity provider. This runs containers on surplus AWS compute power, resulting in up to **70% cost savings** compared to standard on-demand pricing.
* **Amazon CloudFront (CDN)**
  * **Role:** Globally distributes Next.js static assets (`/_next/static/*`) and caches them at edge locations.
  * **Impact:** Reduces latency for users globally and shields the Fargate servers from DDoS attacks.
  * **Cost Optimization:** By offloading static file serving to CloudFront, we reduce the traffic and CPU load on the ECS containers. We also restrict the CloudFront `PriceClass` to `PriceClass_200`, avoiding expensive edge regions.
* **Amazon RDS MySQL (Database)**
  * **Role:** Secure relational database hidden in private subnets.
  * **Impact:** Provides automated backups, encryption at rest, and reliable structured storage for Prisma.
  * **Cost Optimization:** Provisions a `db.t3.micro` instance (highly affordable) with `gp3` auto-scaling storage, meaning you only pay for exactly the disk space you use, rather than over-provisioning storage upfront.
* **Single NAT Gateway (Networking)**
  * **Role:** Allows private Fargate instances to pull updates and send outbound API calls (like SES emails).
  * **Cost Optimization:** Many enterprise setups use one NAT Gateway *per Availability Zone*, which doubles or triples the hourly costs. We explicitly use a **Single NAT Gateway** for the entire VPC to slash fixed monthly network pricing by 50%.
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
  * **Role:** Distributes traffic evenly among Fargate containers and enables zero-downtime rolling deployments.
  * **Cost Optimization:** The Target Group is finely tuned to deregister failing containers extremely quickly, ensuring no traffic or compute seconds are wasted on crashed instances.
* **AWS SES, Secrets Manager, CodePipeline, & KMS**
  * **Role:** SES handles verified email delivery; Secrets Manager injects passwords at boot without exposing them; CodePipeline automates Docker builds; KMS encrypts databases and container image registries.
  * **Cost Optimization:** These are heavily *"pay-per-use"* services that cost virtually $0.00 until your application starts receiving thousands of transactions.

### Step-by-Step AWS Setup for forkers

If you have forked this repository and want to host it on your own AWS account, follow these steps strictly:

#### 1. Setup Deployment Variables
All passwords and sensitive tokens are managed via Terraform variables and injected into AWS Secrets Manager. 

Navigate to the terraform directory:
```bash
cd terraform
```
Copy the example variables file:
```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```
**Open `terraform.tfvars` and fill it out completely.** 
* Set strong passwords for `db_password` (min 12 chars), `admin_password` (min 8 chars), and `nextauth_secret` (generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32`).
* Provide your GitHub repository string (e.g., `arasuaswin/bloodbank-system`).

> ⚠️ **Note:** `terraform.tfvars` is intentionally included in `.gitignore` so your secrets are never accidentally pushed to GitHub.

#### 2. Deploy Infrastructure
We have provided comprehensive PowerShell scripts that completely automate the provisioning, Docker building, database pushing, and AWS deployments natively for Windows machines. 

Open a PowerShell terminal as Administrator, authenticate with your AWS CLI locally, and run:

```powershell
.\deploy_aws.ps1
```
This single script will:
- Check for all prerequisite tools (Docker, AWS CLI, Terraform)
- Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` for you
- Build the Next.js Docker image and push it to Amazon ECR
- Attempt to automate Prisma database schema pushing
- Force-deploy the latest container onto your ECS cluster

#### 3. Connect GitHub to AWS CodePipeline
Because your AWS account needs permission to read your public GitHub repository during automated builds, Terraform creates a pending connection.

1. Log into your **AWS Console**.
2. Navigate to **Developer Tools** ➡️ **Settings** ➡️ **Connections**.
3. You will see a connection named `bloodbank-gms-github-connection` in a `Pending` state.
4. Click on it and choose **Update pending connection**.
5. Follow the prompts to authorize AWS to access your GitHub repositories.

#### 4. Future Deployments & CI/CD
Once the GitHub connection is active and your first Fargate instances are live:
* **To push a new update**: Simply commit your changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository. AWS CodePipeline will automatically fetch the new code, rebuild the Docker image, and perform a rolling update natively.

## 🗑️ Tearing Down Infrastructure

If you wish to completely destroy the AWS infrastructure to stop incurring costs, simply run the included undeploy script from a PowerShell window:

```powershell
.\undeploy_aws.ps1
```
This script will empty the S3 artifact buckets and safely run `terraform destroy` to remove all AWS resources.
